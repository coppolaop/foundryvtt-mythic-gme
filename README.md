![mythic-panel-2.png](mythic-panel-2.png)

This modules provides all mythic rules in the form of Macros. You can use them in whatever RPG system you like in any world.

**To manually import Macros**, enable the module, and then go to the Compendiums tab, you are going to see many compendiums starting with the word **Mythic**. For starters, the most basic one is **Mythic GME Macros**.
Simply drag and drop them to your Macro Hotbar at the bottom of the screen. Then, just click on them and play!

These macros provide complex functionalities summarized in a one-click event.
Most of them bring up a Dialog in which the player customizes or elaborates the event.

Selecting a Token will cause the Macros to interact with a Foundry VTT actor, 
speak on his behalf or even sometimes use its information for better flavor!

#### GM Emulator 2nd Edition
* Discovery meaning tables
* Scene adjustment table
* Weighted lists support
* Element meaning tables included

![mythic-panel-2e.png](mythic-panel-2e.png)

### Unfolding Machines

#### Plot Unfolding Machine

PUM is a GM Emulator that focuses on building up your plot beats and helping you with accurate oracles. [HERE](https://jeansenvaars.itch.io/plot-unfolding-machine) :)

Check it out if getting stuck in your Solo or GMLess games is an often-issue, because PUM is designed to help with coming up with what happenss next in your Solo gaming.

![pum-example.png](pum-example.png)

#### Scene Unfolding Machine

This supplement can be played with PUM, with Mythic, or on its own, and it focuses on narrating elements inside a scene, manipulating a scene, and dealing with NPCs. [HERE](https://jeansenvaars.itch.io/scene-unfolding-machine) :)

It can be a great help in your Solo RPG adventures since it gives you content for things to happen in the momment.

#### Game Unfolding Machine

This supplement can support PUM or Mythic, and it deals with plot seed generation and world building in general. [HERE](https://jeansenvaars.itch.io/game-unfolding-machine) :)

Check it out to expand your stories, game prep, and solo storytelling.

#### The GameMaster's Apprentice

Check out the cards section to learn how to configure them.

![gma-example.png](gma-example.png)

### The Oracle Builder
Create your own Oracles with Random Tables, supporting multiple draws per tables and flavor dialogues
![Oracle Builder](oracle-builder.png)

### Rolling your own tables
Either from Foundry Random Tables or Tables you have outside (printed, or in a PDF, etc), these macros will help you stay sharp and consistent!

#### Flavored Roll Table

Keep chat consistency by rolling from a Random Table normally with a question (flavor) in mind

![img.png](flavored-table-prompt-2.png)

#### External Roll Table

Keep chat and overall consistency by rolling tables outside your game as if they belonged here!

![external-table-prompt-2.png](external-table-prompt-2.png)

![External Table](external-table.png)

### Chat and Exporting

#### General Features

* Every Mythic check in Mythic GME Tools produces a flavored, self-explanatory chat message.
* A setting **Automatic Adventure Logging** (default: disabled) exports all oracle checks **to a journal entry**.
* Resize sidebar for a bigger chat place with [Sidebar Resizer](https://github.com/saif-ellafi/foundryvtt-sidebar-resizer)
* A macro **Export Chat to Journal** allows dumping the current chat into a Journal Entry with a single click.
* Rolling dice with Dice so Nice! module enabled will flavor and slowly produce results as the 3D dice give away their outcomes.

This will help keep track of your emulator's guidance and your game!

![mighty-chat.png](mighty-chat.png) 

#### Formatted Message - Send message to the chat with flavor, color and style

Keep your game chat log clear and consistent, add headers, subtitles, and more

![formatted-message.png](formatted-message.png)

#### Exporting chat records to a Journal Entry
You can do this in three ways:

* By clicking on Export in the Mythic Panel
* By using the Macro to export current Chat to a Journal Entry
* By enabling Auto-Logging setting that automatically puts all your chat in a daily journal

![chat-export2.png](chat-export2.png)

### Customizing your playstyle

There are plenty of configuration options. Go to **Module Settings** in Foundry and check the Mythic GME Tools section!

Tables necessary to execute the aforementioned macros are included, and may also be used independently.

**Macros use Roll Tables**. Going to **Module Settings** lets you choose which tables are used. Table names must begin
with **Mythic** in order to be eligible. By default, Macros pick up Tables **by their name**, so importing the Tables
from the Compendium and making modifications on them, will automatically apply to the Macros that use them.
Try to keep the same format of the tables to avoid issues. Delete imported tables to revert Macros to use the original ones.

### Saved Progress

* Chaos Rank: When changing Chaos Rank, the value will be saved and reused across all functions
* Behavior Checks: Disposition and descriptors are stored within actor tokens, by selecting the token before running the Macro.
* Statistic Checks: Stats are stored within actor tokens, by selecting the token before running the Macro.

### Card Decks

**NOTE** - Deck Images are not included and can be purchased from DriveThruRPG or similar outlets.
